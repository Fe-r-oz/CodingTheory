# Notes
* The hypergraph product is defined in "J. Tillich, G. ZÃ©mor. Quantum LDPC codes
  with positive rate and minimum distance proportional to n^(1/2). (2013)
  arXiv:0903.0566v2"
* The generalized Shor code is defined in "D. Bacon and A. Casaccino. Quantum
  error correcting subsystem codes from two classical linear codes. (2006)
  http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610088"
* Hyperbicycle codes are found in "Quantum ``hyperbicycle'' low-density parity check
  codes with finite rate" and "Quantum Kronecker sum-product low-density parity-check
  codes with finite rate".
* Generealized bicycle codes are are found in "Quantum ``hyperbicycle'' low-density parity check
  codes with finite rate", "Quantum kronecker sum-product low-density parity- check codes with
  finite rate", and "Degenerate Quantum LDPC Codes With Good Finite Length Performance".
