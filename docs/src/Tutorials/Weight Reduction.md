# Weight Reduction

## Classical Codes

Weight reduction for classical codes refers to techniques used to reduce the row and column weights of parity-check matrices. Since there are many methods to create high quality LDPC codes already, the purpose of this is not to create good linear codes in their own right, but instead for use in quantum product codes as seen in OUR PAPER HERE.
